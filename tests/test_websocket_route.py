"""Tests for the WebSocket route endpoint (/api/ws).

These integration tests verify the WebSocket endpoint behavior:
- Initial health message sent on connect
- Ping/pong keepalive mechanism
- Clean disconnect handling

Uses FastAPI's TestClient synchronous WebSocket support with mocked
radio_manager and health data dependencies.
